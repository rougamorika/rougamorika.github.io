# Introduction to Derivatives

The derivative is one of the most fundamental concepts in calculus. It measures how a function changes as its input changes, representing the instantaneous rate of change.

## The Limit Definition

The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x$ is defined as:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

This limit, if it exists, gives us the slope of the tangent line to the curve $y = f(x)$ at the point $(x, f(x))$.

## Notation

There are several common notations for derivatives:

- **Leibniz notation**: $\frac{df}{dx}$ or $\frac{dy}{dx}$
- **Lagrange notation**: $f'(x)$ or $y'$
- **Newton notation**: $\dot{f}$ or $\dot{y}$

## Basic Derivative Rules

### Power Rule

For any real number $n$:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}
$$

**Example**: $\frac{d}{dx}(x^3) = 3x^2$

### Constant Rule

The derivative of a constant is zero:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(c) = 0
$$

### Sum Rule

The derivative of a sum is the sum of derivatives:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)
$$

### Product Rule

For the product of two functions:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
$$

### Quotient Rule

For the quotient of two functions:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right] = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}
$$

### Chain Rule

For composite functions:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
$$

## Common Derivatives

Here are derivatives of common functions:

| Function | Derivative |
|----------|------------|
| $\sin(x)$ | $\cos(x)$ |
| $\cos(x)$ | $-\sin(x)$ |
| $e^x$ | $e^x$ |
| $\ln(x)$ | $\frac{1}{x}$ |
| $\tan(x)$ | $\sec^2(x)$ |

## Higher-Order Derivatives

We can take derivatives of derivatives:

- **Second derivative**: $f''(x) = \frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$
- **Third derivative**: $f'''(x) = \frac{d^3f}{dx^3}$
- **$n$-th derivative**: $f^{(n)}(x) = \frac{d^nf}{dx^n}$

## Example: Finding a Derivative

Let's find the derivative of $f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7$:

$$
\begin{align}
f'(x) &= \frac{d}{dx}(3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7) \\
&= 3 \cdot 4x^3 - 2 \cdot 2x + 5 - 0 \\
&= 12x^3 - 4x + 5
\end{align}
$$

## Applications of Derivatives

### 1. Finding Tangent Lines

The equation of the tangent line to $y = f(x)$ at $x = a$ is:

$$
y - f(a) = f'(a)(x - a)
$$

### 2. Optimization

To find maximum or minimum values:
1. Find critical points where $f'(x) = 0$ or $f'(x)$ doesn't exist
2. Use the second derivative test: $f''(x) > 0$ indicates a minimum, $f''(x) < 0$ indicates a maximum

### 3. Related Rates

Derivatives help us understand how different quantities change with respect to each other over time.

### 4. Physics Applications

- **Velocity**: $v(t) = \frac{ds}{dt}$ (derivative of position)
- **Acceleration**: $a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2s}{dt^2}$ (derivative of velocity)

## Geometric Interpretation

The derivative $f'(a)$ represents:
- The slope of the tangent line at $x = a$
- The instantaneous rate of change at $x = a$
- How fast $f(x)$ is changing at $x = a$

## Summary

Derivatives are essential for:
- Understanding rates of change
- Optimization problems
- Modeling physical phenomena
- Analyzing function behavior
